A fun little project so I can incorporate my passion for skincare with CS!

Here is a little sneak peek of the website!

This is the default home page

This is the home page for me (admin) so that I can easily create new posts and add it to the blog

Each blog post follows the same structure as well as includes a comment section! Users are able to make and add comments, but need to be logged in and have an account before being able to do so.
If the user is not logged in, they are unable to leave comments.
